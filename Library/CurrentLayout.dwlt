      Description: 'Our new Addressable Asset System allows the developer to ask for an asset via its address and get back the thing that resides at that address. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked "addressable", it generates an address which can be called from anywhere. Wherever the asset resides (local or remote), the system will locate it and its dependencies, then return it.


        The Addressable Asset System uses asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies. Whether you are using direct references, traditional asset bundles, or Resource folders, addressable assets provide a simpler way to make your game more dynamic. The Addressable Asset System  simultaneously opens up the world of asset bundles while managing all the complexity.'

      Description: 'Our new Addressable Asset System allows the developer to ask for an asset via its address and get back the thing that resides at that address. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked "addressable", it generates an address which can be called from anywhere. Wherever the asset resides (local or remote), the system will locate it and its dependencies, then return it.


        The Addressable Asset System uses asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies. Whether you are using direct references, traditional asset bundles, or Resource folders, addressable assets provide a simpler way to make your game more dynamic. The Addressable Asset System  simultaneously opens up the world of asset bundles while managing all the complexity.'

        TextMesh Pro provides Improved Control over text formatting and layout with features like character, word, line and paragraph spacing, kerning, justified text, Links, over 30 Rich Text Tags available, support for Multi Font & Sprites, Custom Styles and more.


        Great performance. Since the geometry created by TextMesh Pro uses two triangles per character just like Unity''s text components, this improved visual quality and flexibility comes at no additional performance cost.'

      Description: 'Our new Addressable Asset System allows the developer to ask for an asset via its address and get back the thing that resides at that address. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked "addressable", it generates an address which can be called from anywhere. Wherever the asset resides (local or remote), the system will locate it and its dependencies, then return it.


        The Addressable Asset System uses asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies. Whether you are using direct references, traditional asset bundles, or Resource folders, addressable assets provide a simpler way to make your game more dynamic.

      Description: 'Our new Addressable Asset System allows the developer to ask for an asset via its address and get back the thing that resides at that address. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked "addressable", it generates an address which can be called from anywhere. Wherever the asset resides (local or remote), the system will locate it and its dependencies, then return it.


        The Addressable Asset System uses asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies. Whether you are using direct references, traditional asset bundles, or Resource folders, addressable assets provide a simpler way to make your game more dynamic. The Addressable Asset System  simultaneously opens up the world of asset bundles while managing all the complexity.'

      _Version: 1.0.27
      Description: 'TextMesh Pro is the ultimate text solution for Unity. It''s the perfect replacement for Unity''s UI Text and the legacy Text Mesh.


        Powerful and easy to use, TextMesh Pro uses Advanced Text Rendering techniques along with a set of custom shaders; delivering substantial visual quality improvements while giving users incredible flexibility when it comes to text styling and texturing.


        TextMesh Pro provides Improved Control over text formatting and layout with features like character, word, line and paragraph spacing, kerning, justified text, Links, over 30 Rich Text Tags available, support for Multi Font & Sprites, Custom Styles and more.


        Great performance. Since the geometry created by TextMesh Pro uses two triangles per character just like Unity''s text components, this improved visual quality and flexibility comes at no additional performance cost.'

      Description: 'TextMesh Pro is the ultimate text solution for Unity. It''s the perfect replacement for Unity''s UI Text and the legacy Text Mesh.


        Powerful and easy to use, TextMesh Pro uses Advanced Text Rendering techniques along with a set of custom shaders; delivering substantial visual quality improvements while giving users incredible flexibility when it comes to text styling and texturing.


        TextMesh Pro provides Improved Control over text formatting and layout with features like character, word, line and paragraph spacing, kerning, justified text, Links, over 30 Rich Text Tags available, support for Multi Font & Sprites, Custom Styles and more.


        Great performance. Since the geometry created by TextMesh Pro uses two triangles per character just like Unity''s text components, this improved visual quality and flexibility comes at no additional performance cost.'
